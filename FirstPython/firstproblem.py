# 🧮 Basic Math Problems

# 1. Sum of Two Numbers
# Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and prints their sum.
x = input ("Please input first value: ")
y = input("Please input second value: ")

s = int(x) + int(y)
print(s)

# 2. Even or Odd
# Ask the user to enter a number and print whether it’s even or odd.
def test(n):
    x = input("Input a Number: ")

    y =n%2
    if y==0:
        print("The inputed number is EVEN")
    else:
        print("The inputed number is ODD")

# 3. Multiplication Table
# Print the multiplication table of a number entered by the user.


# 🔁 Loops and Conditionals

# 4. Print Numbers 1 to 10
# Use a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

# 5. Sum of N Natural Numbers
# Ask the user for a number n and print the sum of all numbers from 1 to n.

# 6. Factorial
# Ask the user for a number and print its factorial.


# 🔤 Strings

# 7. Palindrome Checker
# Check if a string entered by the user is a palindrome.

# 8. Count Vowels
# Count the number of vowels in a user-entered string.

# 9. Reverse a String
# Print the reverse of a string entered by the user.


# 🗃️ Lists and Basic Data Structures

# 10. Find the Largest Number in a List
